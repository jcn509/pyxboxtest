# WIP end-to-end test framework for Xbox software built with the NXDK
Supports XQEMU and hopefully soon CXBX-R. XQEMU may well be better, as it is unclear how well supported nxdk is with CXBX-R. CXBX-R support would be nice as with CXBX-R (unlike with XQEMU) you do not need a copy of the BiOS or MCPX rom, and that would make it far easier to run tests on CI platforms legally.

# Implemented
 - Running games
 - Capturing kernel debug output
 - Screenshots
